* Releases are GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to your users.
* With Releases, you can provide links to binary files, as well as release notes describing your changes.
* There are no limits on the total number of files uploaded per release except that each individual file must be under 2GB in size.
* Release links can be accessed using the GitHub api including useful extras such as download stats.
