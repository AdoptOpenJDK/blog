Exactly a year ago today, Tim Ellison sent me a note.  He had just watched a presentation I had recorded, talking about the work my team had started to vastly 'simplify Java testing'.

He mentioned that there was this project he was involved with, "AdoptOpenJDK", where they were talking about some of the same concepts that we were implementing.  He wondered if what we had started implementing could be used at this project.  I replied, "sure, by when".  His answer, "last week".

Here we are, 1 year later, diligently improving the way we test Java.  I am witnessing the vision that we had laid out over a year ago of "make test... better" become reality.  It is a collaborative and fun effort!  Running [all kinds of testing](https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2017/12/testing-java-help-count-ways), and very notably this week, AdoptOpenJDK project is able to claim its first JCK certified builds, starting with openjdk8-openj9 builds on 3 Linux platforms (x64/ppc64le/s390x).  See the check marks in the [openjdk8-openj9 build archive](https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk8-openj9)  (also available in [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/adoptopenjdk/openjdk8-openj9/)).

I really do feel lucky to be part of this project, and to work with the small but dedicated team of folks who make it fly.  A big thank you and congratulations to the team on this anniversary of sorts, and oh how you capped it off with the JCK compliant icing!  I can only imagine what it will look like a year from now, as we continue to innovate, refine and deliver on our goals.
