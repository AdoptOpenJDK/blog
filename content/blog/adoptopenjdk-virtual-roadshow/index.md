Join the AdoptOpenJDK virtual roadshow as we speak at a JUG near you!

![Duke with mask](./duke_mask.png)

AdoptOpenJDK is doing a virtual roadshow of the Java User Groups. We plan to reach as many groups as possible but we will also live stream the event on YouTube.

## Abstract
AdoptOpenJDK is rapidly becoming a leading provider of OpenJDK™ binaries. With over 140 million downloads in the last year, it is now a serious contender for your production usage of Java™. AdoptOpenJDK provides prebuilt OpenJDK™ binaries from a fully open source set of build scripts and infrastructure. This talk will cover how we build on over 15 different platforms, execute over 87 million tests and distribute OpenJDK™ binaries to millions of users. We will also cover how AdoptOpenJDK binaries compare against the Java™ binaries that you use today. If you're curious to understand the difference between OpenJDK™, Oracle Java™, AdoptOpenJDK and all the other distributions, then this is the talk for you!
