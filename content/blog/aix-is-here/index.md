A couple of weeks ago we had a pair of 10 cpu, 32gb ram AIX machines setup for us at the OSU Open Source Lab in Oregon. We have been playing around with the configuration on them for the last few weeks but I think that we've got our build recipe right now.<!-- excerpt-end --> Go ahead and grab our binaries from [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html#ppc64_aix).

Please not that these binaries are currently untested and are not recommended for production use.
