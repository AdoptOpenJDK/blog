Adding third party application tests into the automated testing at AdoptOpenJDK is easier now than it has ever been!

There exists a template project in the [openjdk-test ](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/)repository that can be customized to fit any third party application and run as part of the [External Tests builds](https://ci.adoptopenjdk.net/view/External%20tests/) at Adopt.

The thirdparty_containers [README](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/blob/master/thirdparty_containers/README.md)Â file outlines the steps involved in this process.

For a practical example, you may also want to go over the following demo. It shows how we have added the Lucene-Solr nightly smoke test to the list of third party application tests at Adopt.

Please feel free to [grow the list of third party application tests we run in AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-tests/issues/172).
