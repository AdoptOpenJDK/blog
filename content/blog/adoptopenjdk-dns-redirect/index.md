From today, several HTTP redirects have been applied to the adoptopenjdk.net domain name. Most notably, users now trying to navigate to the homepage will be redirected to our new home at https://adoptium.net.

## Can I still download AdoptOpenJDK binaries?

Yes, the binary download pages will continue to be served up including:

- Latest Releases (albeit nearly always serving Temurin binaries) https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html
- Archive Releease: https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html
- API: https://api.adoptopenjdk.net

These redirects are part of a larger initiative to get migrate our remaining users to Eclipse Temurin wherever possible to ensure that they receive the latest security updates.
