With the recent changes to Oracle JDK distribution and support there has been considerable uncertainty in the Java ecosystem. In particular there is confusion over the rights to use Oracle JDK vs Oracle's OpenJDK builds vs OpenJDK builds from other providers such as [AdoptOpenJDK](https://www.adoptopenjdk.net)!

Working with the various providers, the [Java Champions](https://community.oracle.com/community/technology_network_community/java/java-champions) (an independent body of Java experts) have put together a comprehensive [Java Is Still Free](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nFGazvrCvHMZJgFstlbzoHjpAVwv5DEdnaBr_5pKuHo/edit?usp=sharing) document on the changes. It also covers the choices you have going forward, and yes Java is Still Free!

The [Java Is Still Free](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nFGazvrCvHMZJgFstlbzoHjpAVwv5DEdnaBr_5pKuHo/edit?usp=sharing) document has comments and suggested edit access switched on and will periodically be updated to reflect the latest accurate information. It is being [Disseminated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQ7Hov5_NBPRDORYva-8tTUZF8cq-YChAJZHb487fTA/edit?usp=sharing) widely and we'd appreciate you sharing this with your colleagues and within your organisations.  Please do update the [Disseminated](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UQ7Hov5_NBPRDORYva-8tTUZF8cq-YChAJZHb487fTA/edit?usp=sharing) doc when you do so!

Of course we believe our AdoptOpenJDK binaries are a great choice.  As a reminder here is the [Support policy](https://www.adoptopenjdk.net/support.html) for our binaries.
