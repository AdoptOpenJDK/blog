AdoptOpenJDK has certainly come a long way over the last few months!

We have a clean, bright [website](http://www.adoptopenjdk.net) to distribute binaries of [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/), with exciting plans for how it can be improved in the future.

Behind the website "shop front" there is a large continuous integration build and test farm, covering [multiple operating system and hardware combinations](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-infrastructure/blob/master/docs/adoptopenjdk.pdf).  The farm is put to good use compiling the OpenJDK code and running it through a suite of tests before publishing it.

All of our code is out there in [Github](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK) for you to study, so you know exactly what those binaries contain and how they were built.  We believe in open build and open testing of the open source code!

We started with OpenJDK version 8 as the latest stable code stream.  Now that the OpenJDK project is close to declaring the OpenJDK version 9 final, we have started building and testing that too, and expect to have tested binaries available from [the AdoptOpenJDK website](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk9) and [via our API](https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/README) simultaneously.

We are also happy to see the proposal for [Eclipse OpenJ9](http://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-openj9) as another main stream open source Java Virtual Machine.  Once that code is available we will take a look with a view to building and testing OpenJDK with Eclipse OpenJ9 binaries too.

As an open build, test and distribution project we aim to be the "go to" location for high quality OpenJDK-based runtimes; and we are working hard to earn that reputation.  If you are maintaining an OpenJDK derived runtime, drop us a note.

There are many interesting and challenging tasks ahead.  Everyone is welcome to participate at whatever level suits you best.  Take a look at some of [the work we know we need to do](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues), or join us on [Slack](https://adoptopenjdk.slackarchive.io/) to talk about your new ideas.

We are grateful to [the sponsors](https://adoptopenjdk.net/sponsors.html) who recognize the value of this project and have generously provided services and resources to make it successful.

The next few months are going to be equally exciting!  Join in.
