Recently, I had the good fortune to speak (fondly!) about some excellent open-source projects that I participate in...  AdoptOpenJDK, Eclipse OpenJ9 and Eclipse OMR.  Across those three projects, we are trying to simplify the activity of testing.  One of the great side-effects of simpler, easier testing is that it frees up time to do some fun work around building microservices for test.  We hope that we can eventually bring the best of these microservices into the open also, to help all open-source endeavours be even better at the activities of test.

If you are interested in hearing more about microservices for test, please give a listen to "[Cloud-based Test Microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMOjDA-ZyXs)", a presentation which I gave at the Eurostar conference in Copenhagen this year.
